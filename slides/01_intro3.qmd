## Existing models - limitations

::: {.notes}
there are over 100 Mha of forest for which we have no yield curves. And while we do not need to report on those forests, it is of great scientific interest to also quantify the C balance of those forests, as is the plan for the next generation system.  The curves developed in this project will enable national-scale coverage, inculding unmanaged forests
