## Next steps

 - Characterize uncertainty associated with yield curves
 - Generate curves for different spatial units of interest (e.g., ecodistricts, ecoregions)
 - Develop curves for additional attributes (e.g. volume)
 - Develop curves using outputs of ensemble models (i.e., multiple AGB inputs)
